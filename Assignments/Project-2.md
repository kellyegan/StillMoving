### DUE: Mar. 14

For this project we will create looping videos compositions. Using Adobe After Effects, build a composition that loops, playing continuously. The loop can imply a narrative, but it should not be an obvious “story” in the linear sense. Your piece shouldn't imply an obvious beginning or end. The piece may also be abstract with no recognizable subject.

The use of time in the loop may be slow and barely discernible to fast with lots of motion and cuts. It may be simple and slow, or complex, involving loops within loops, with lots of movement or other temporal changes. The piece should however have some motion or transition over its length.

Also consider the idea of loops more broadly. Take some time to think of the various ways loops can be found in life and metaphor. How does the idea of a loop defy time or enhance it? Can you your work address the concepts of loops more conceptually? What is time without progress? Motion without movement?

* You piece should between 30 seconds and three minutes long.
* Piece should be exported to an MP4 file for viewing in class.
* Please bring the original source material and After Effects project in case we want to discuss process.
