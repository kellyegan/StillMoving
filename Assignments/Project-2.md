### DUE: Mar. 14

For this project we will address the subject of time without progress.  Using Adobe AfterEffects and any appropriate support applications, build a video loop which plays continuously. The loop can imply a narrative, but it should not be an obvious “story” in the linear sense. Your piece shouldn't imply an obvious beginning or end.

The use of time in the loop may be slow and barely discernible to fast with lost of motion and cuts. It may be simple, almost like a still photograph, or complex, involving loops within loops, with lots of movement or other temporal changes. 

You can also consider the idea of loops more broadly. Take some time to think of the various ways loops can be found in life and metaphor. How does the idea of a loop defy time or enhance it?

You piece should be one to three minutes long.
