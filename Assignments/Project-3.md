Description

In this project we will address how a time-based work might address the context in which it is found. How can placing the moving image within an environment alter both our perception of the work and the enviroment. This could take a variety of forms, installation, projection mapping, working with existing infrastructure, screens, mobile devices or performance. We will spend some time between now and the critique looking at technical possibilities like project mapping.

* The piece should include some element of time-based imagery or moving image.
* It should relate to a specific environment, location or type of environment.
* If it is an environment that is inaccessible or inconvenient to reach during critique you may show high-quality documentation instead.
