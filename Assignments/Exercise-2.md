### DUE: Feb. 28

Using After Effects create a 8 different transitions between two images. You can use any layer properties or effect except for pre-made transitions. The purpose of this exercise is to experiment and learn about using keyframes with animations and effects. Your transitions animations can be as short as a few seconds, but you might want to experiment with longer transitions.

**Please include:**

* Use different parameters and effects, interesting animations will likely require combining different effects.
* Experiment with easing and if you want to try something more advance animation curves.
* Include a single MP4 export with all the animations with a 2 second of black between each.
* Please bring the After Effects project (with source materials) we may want to explore your technique.
