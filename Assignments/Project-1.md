### DUE: Thurs. Feb. 28

In this project we will create pre-cinematic devices using lenses, mirrors, pinholes, and other techniques. Your device can act as a projector, camera obscura, a panorama, an animation, a box you peep through or some other form but it should have some optical element (lenses, mirrors, animation, use of light, etc.) and involve some form of movement or animation. The specific subject matter or content is up to you.

**Before beginning, look through the list of pre-cinematic techniques on [resources](resources) page.** Can you identify common elements and techniques of various approaches? Can you combine techniques to form a new one? Movement can occur in a number of ways: mechanical motion of an object or image, change in an lighting or environment, position of the viewer are just some examples. Take some time to explore your techniques before beginning your final device. Small changes can have a great affect on how well they works. Be sure to document your process with notes or photographs.

Be sure to spend some time exploring the various tropes and common subject matter used. These devices filled a void in a world where travel and media were hard to come by. Who were their audiences? Will your piece reference this historical  subject matter? If so how will it critique or build upon it? You can also consider the idea of motion or movement metaphorically. Movements can be political, emotional and intellectual as well.
