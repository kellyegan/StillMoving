### DUE: Sep. 26

For this project we will explore the techniques of pre-cinematic devices by creating our own. Using lenses, mirrors, pinholes, paper, and cardboard create an optical device that addresses the concept of movement. Movement can occur in a number of ways: mechanical motion, an exterior scene, rapidly changing images, mirrors, or potentially other ways. Also take some time to address the idea of movements other meanings when creating the piece.

This device can act as a projector, camera obscura, a diorama, a box you peep through or some other form but it should have some optical element (lenses, mirrors, animation, lights etc) and must address movement in some form.
