# Project 1: Black box

### DUE: Sep. 26

For this project we will explore the techniques of Pre-Cinematic devices by creating our own. Using lenses, mirrors, pinholes, paper, and cardboard create an optical device that addresses the concept of movement. Moment can occur in a number of ways: mechinical motion, an exterior scene, rapidally changing images, mirrors, or potentiall other ways. Also take some time to address the idea of movements other meanings when creating the content.

This device can act as a projector, camera obscura, a diorama, a box you peep through or some other form but it should have some optical element (lenses, mirrors, animation, lights etc) and must address movement in some form.
