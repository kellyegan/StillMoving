### DUE: Thurs. Feb. 28

For this project we will explore the techniques of pre-cinematic devices by creating our own. Using lenses, mirrors, pinholes, cardboard, and other material create an optical device that addresses the concept of movement. Movement can occur in a number of ways: mechanical motion, an exterior scene, rapidly changing images, mirrors, or potentially other ways. Also take some time to address the idea of movements as a metaphor when creating the piece.

This device can act as a projector, camera obscura, a diorama, a box you peep through or some other form but it should have some optical element (lenses, mirrors, animation, lights etc) and must address movement in some form.

Go to the [resources](resources) page to see a list of examples of **pre-cinematic devices**.
