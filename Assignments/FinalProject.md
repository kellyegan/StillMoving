### DUE: May. 9

#### PROPOSAL DUE: Apr. 4
#### WORK-IN-PROGRESS CRIT: Apr. 25

For your final project, you can choose what you would like to focus on and how you would like to implement your work. Your project should involve some aspect of time-based or moving images but you can choose in what direction you would like to go.

Before starting you should write a proposal describing what you would like to explore and how you plan to tackle that topic. Your proposal should include a one paragraph description and a list of at least three to five questions you would like deal with in your work. Sketches or small maquetes may help you explain or refine your project.

You can approach your work in several ways: 

#### Complete artwork
In this case the work should be refined and complete work. It should be a work that could be exhibited publicly. You should be able to talk clearly about your process and goals for the piece as well as the results of the finished work.

#### Body of experiments
The experiements can be on a particular technique or topic. Each experiment may be less refined but as a group the work should show an in-depth exploration of the technique or topic. The body should push boundaries and/or show clear progress in tackling your chosen topic. You should still be able to speak clearly about what you learned from the process and what directions you found fruitful.

* The piece should include some element of time-based imagery or moving image.
* You should submit a written proposal with a one-paragraph description, and three to five questions you hope to explore.
* Either a singular finished artwork or a series of experiments that explore a topic or technique.
