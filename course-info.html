<p class="lead">The still photograph is an anomaly in the history of image making. The first optical device, the camera obscura creates an image as fluid as the world it reflects. Optical toys such as  thaumatropes, zoetropes, magic lanterns anticipated cinematic moving images even before photography was born and as soon as technology allowed, photographers and scientists such as Marey and Muybridge began to reanimate the frozen moment.</p>

<p class="lead">Today we are immersed in moving images, they have become a part of our language, interspersed in digital conversation. It has also begun to move in new ways, through fast networks and social spaces, and lately through the multidimensional space of machine learning.</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This course will explore photography in relation to this broad history. We will look at various ways to use and present images, beyond paper, including projection, installation, interaction, virtual reality and digital networks.</p>

<p>We will use a number of tools to help with this exploration. We will start by working with Adobe After Effects as one of our primary tools to manipulate images, animations and video. After Effects will be an important tool throughout the course. In addition we will spend some time learning the basics of creative coding using Processing to allow for works that are responsive and interactive as well as to allow us the ability to define our own tools. We will also look at a number of other software and hardware tools that can expand our possibilities</p>.

<h2>Expectations</h2>

<h3>Attendance</h3>
<p>Because collaborative learning is so central to this course, attendance is critical to your success. If sickness or other personal reasons prevent your attendance please contact the instructor as soon as possible.
</p>

<h3>Plagerism</h3>
<p>Issues of appropriation, reproduction and reuse may arise during this course. In the interest of academic honesty, students should keep track of the sources of the materials, text and code they use in their coursework. Please include a list of sources and citations used with any completed work.
</p>

<p>Please see RISD's Academic Code of Conduct for a detail description of school policies.</p>


<h2>Required materials and tools</h2>

<p>There is no required text for this class. We will primarily using software available to RISD students or that is free and open source.</p>

<p>Students will need a camera for shooting video and still photographs.</p>
