<p class="lead">The still photograph is an anomaly in the history of image making. The first optical device, the camera obscura creates an image as fluid as the world it reflects. Optical toys such as  thaumatropes, zoetropes, magic lanterns anticipated cinematic moving images even before photography was born and as soon as technology allowed, photographers and scientists such as Marey and Muybridge began to reanimate the frozen moment. </p>

<p class="lead">Today we are immersed in moving images, they have become a part of our language, interspersed in digital conversation. The moving image, through virtual and augmented reality has taken forms that echo pre-cinematic experiences. It has also begun to move in new ways, through fast networks and social spaces, and lately through the multidimensional space of machine learning.

    <h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This course will explore photography in relation to this broad history. We will look at various ways to use and present images, beyond paper, including projection, installation, interaction, virtual reality and digital networks.</p>

<p>We will use a number of tools to help with this exploration. We will start by working with Adobe After Effects as one of our primary tools to manipulate images, animations and video. After Effects will be an important tool throughout the course. In addition we will spend some time learning the basics of creative coding using Processing to allow for works that are responsive and interactive as well as to allow us the ability to define our own tools. We will also look at a number of other software and hardware tools that can expand our possibilities</p>.
